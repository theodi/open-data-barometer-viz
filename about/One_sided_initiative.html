<h2>One Sided Initiatives</h2>
These countries each have <b>some form of open data initiative</b>, ranging from departmental web pages listing open data, to full open data portals. However, government action to publish selected datasets is <b>not matched by civil society capacity and freedom to engage with the data</b>, <b>nor by private sector involvement</b> in the open data process. As a result, these initiatives appear to be very <b>supply-side driven</b>, without engagement with a broad community of users. Without wider political freedoms, the potential of open data to bring about political and social change in these contexts will be limited.
