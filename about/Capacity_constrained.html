<h2>Capacity constrained</h2>
<p>The countries in this cluster all <b>face challenges in establishing sustainable open data initiatives</b> as a result of <b>limited government, civil society or private sector capacity</b>, <b>limits on affordable widespread Internet access</b>, and <b>weaknesses in digital data collection and management</b>. A small number of the countries in this cluster, such as Kenya, Ghana and Indonesia, have established open data initiatives, but these remain <b>highly dependent upon a small network of leaders and technical experts</b>. Without sustained leadership and investment, moves towards open data are difficult to make sustainable, as Kenyaâ€™s dramatic fall in the Barometer rankings demonstrates. <b>Limited availability of relevant training and technical capacity</b> for working with open data presents an extra challenge for these countries to overcome in developing the availability and use of open data.
